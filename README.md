### What is this?
This repo contains solutions of algorithmic, cryptographic, mathematic, etc problems from mine along with the contributors.

Each person should have their own branch containing their solutions. After the end of each week, me (the repo owner) will merge the code to branch Master.

### Purpose:
The purpose of this repo is to remind and empower the responsibility of each person to constantly improve themselves over time.
